It is located in the northernmost part of the Earth and consists of the Arctic Ocean, as well as parts of Canada, Russia, Greenland, the United States, Norway, Finland, Sweden, and Iceland.

Europe and Asia are traditionally considered separate continents, but some geographers consider them one single continent called Eurasia, due to the lack of a distinct geological boundary between the two.

Therefore, the classification of Europe and Asia as separate continents is somewhat arbitrary.
